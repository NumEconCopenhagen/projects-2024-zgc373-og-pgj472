# Inaugural project

In this project we are analysing an exchange economy with two consumers A and B and a market that cosists of two goods x1 and x2.
Through eight questions, we investigate utility, allocations, and prices under various assumptions and market conditions.
We solve the questions by applying Python tools and code. 
Every answer follows a structure that is first a short introduction to the task, second our code with steps and explanations and the corresponding results.  Finally our concluding remarks to the results to the specific question.  

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
