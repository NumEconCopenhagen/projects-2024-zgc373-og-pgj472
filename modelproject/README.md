# Model analysis project

**The Cournot Model**.

In our project, we have provided an explanation and solution to the Cournot duopoly model, both analytically and numerically. Furthermore, we have expanded the Cournot model to include a scenario of duopoly versus monopoly (collusion), yielding results consistent with economic theory.

The Cournot model is an economic model showing how two firms compete by setting their production quantities independently and simultaneously. This model applies when firms produce identical goods and do not engage in collusion. Each firm strives to maximize profit, assuming its rival pursues the same objective.

In the first part of our project, the analytical and numerical analyses, we have shown how the choices of quantities made by the two firms are influenced by varying parameter values such as ùëé, ùëè, and ùëÄùê∂ (marginal cost). This relationship is depicted in our interactive plot showcasing the best response functions of the firms. Additionally, the plot illustrates how the identical price set by both firms corresponds to their production levels and demonstrates the resulting changes in the firms' profits based on different quantities and parameter values.

In the second part of the project, titled "Further Analysis," we have expanded the model by introducing the assumption of collusion between the two firms, effectively forming a monopoly. This expansion is rooted in economic theory, which posits that both firms have an incentive to collude to maximize profits while producing a reduced quantity of goods. We configured the Cournot model to encompass both the duopoly and collusion (monopoly) scenarios, showcasing the expected outcomes predicted by economic theory: a reduction in quantities, an increase in price, higher profits, a decrease in consumer surplus, and an increase in producer surplus as the firms transition from a duopoly to a monopoly.
